# Counter

## Challenge and main idea of the mini project

Understanding the basic ideas of a language/toolkit.

## Criteria

-   Build a frame containing a label or read-only textfield and a button.
-   Initially, the value in the textfield is 0.
-   Each click of the button increases the value in textfield by 1.
-   Counter serves as a gentle introduction to the basics of the language, paradigm and toolkit for one of the simplest GUI applications imaginable. Thus, Counter reveals the required scaffolding and how the very basic features work together to build a GUI application. A good solution will have almost no scaffolding.

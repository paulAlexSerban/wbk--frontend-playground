## JavaScript - Quotation Generator

> [OpenClassrooms.com](https://openclassrooms.com/) - Front End Developer Path - Project 5 - Vanilla JavaScript Quotation Generator

## Project Brief

Use JavaScript programming and algorithms to build a random quote generator. The quotes will be randomly constructed by assembling different pieces of a sentence.

### Step 1: Random quotes

- A random quotation or text generator is a tool that creates random fake quotes by assembling sentence fragments.

#### Criteria:

- The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call;
- Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end);
- The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example);
- The program can simply display each result in the JavaScript console;

#### Step 2: More customized quotes

You now want to go further and offer more options.

#### Criteria:

- Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5);
- Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences);
- Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program;

# Layouts

- Reusable Layout patterns
- Only LAYOUT related properties that can be inherited by the components
- NO COSMETIC STYLING ALLOWED IN HERE
- It is useful to have a site/page layout for distributing the main elements.

# Warning

- do nt create layout entry files, as you will need to import a template that might use one of the template as layout container, and it will create a circular dependency error and crash the app

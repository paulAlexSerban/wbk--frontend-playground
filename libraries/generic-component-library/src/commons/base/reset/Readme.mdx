# Reset

## Reset and Normalize

Both normalize.css and reset.css are used to override the default styles that browsers apply to HTML elements, but they are used in slightly different ways.

**Reset.css:**

Reset.css is a CSS file that resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline. In other words, it removes all the default styles that browsers apply to HTML elements. The idea is that by starting from a completely blank slate, developers can ensure that all browsers render their site in the same way.

The downside of using a reset file is that you will have to explicitly declare all your styles. Some developers might find this tedious, as you'll have to redeclare a lot of very basic styles (like font sizes for headings, paragraph spacing, etc.) that you might take for granted.

**Normalize.css:**

Normalize.css, on the other hand, is a bit more sophisticated. Instead of completely stripping away all default styles, it preserves useful defaults and corrects any inconsistencies that might exist between different browsers.

Unlike reset.css, normalize.css doesn't eradicate all default browser styling. What it does is that it makes styles consistent across different browsers and makes sure that useful defaults are preserved.

In conclusion, the difference between reset.css and normalize.css is about the methodology and philosophy behind them:

- Reset.css removes all default styles, providing you with a clean slate to work on. This can be beneficial if you're planning to heavily customize every element of your website and want to ensure the utmost consistency between different browsers.
- Normalize.css, meanwhile, maintains some default styles and only modifies those which are inconsistent between different browsers. This can save you some work if you're fine with many of the default styles and only want to ensure that they are applied consistently across different browsers.

## Best Practices

Typically, using both normalize.css and reset.css in the same project isn't recommended. Both files essentially serve the same purpose: to create a consistent baseline for your styles across different browsers. However, they go about this in different ways, as described in the previous response.

Using them both at the same time could lead to unnecessary repetition and conflicts, as both of them aim to handle browser inconsistencies, albeit in different ways. This could result in some styles being overridden, which could cause confusion and make debugging more difficult.

Here's what you should consider:

- If you want to completely strip all browser styles and start from scratch, then use reset.css. Just bear in mind that this also removes many sensible defaults, so you'll need to explicitly re-define a lot of basic styles.
- If you prefer to start with many of the default styles and only want to correct the inconsistencies, then use normalize.css. It's a bit more nuanced in that it maintains some defaults, rather than bulldozing all styles like reset.css.

So, the choice between normalize.css and reset.css should be based on your project requirements and personal preference as a developer.

Remember, CSS methodologies and best practices can evolve over time, so always consider the specific needs of your project and current trends in the field when making your decision.
